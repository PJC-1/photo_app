## **User's Story**:
___



* Sprint 1: The user should be able to visit a general splash page with the name of the website and links for the user to "Log in" and "Sign up". After logging in the user will be redirected to their profile page which contains there personal feed(user's photos), here they can update profile information, upload a personal avatar, view their pictures, the user can click the upload image button to upload a picture, while uploading a picture a "title" can be added to the picture description, the user can also add tag names to the picture so that other users can search for pictures with that tag name, and be able to click on those pictures to see a single picture show page.



* Sprint 2: From the set of links on the navbar the user will be able to visit "News Feed" page that features a randomized feed of all the users photos. These titles will be links for the posts page. The user will be able to user a search bar at the top of the page to search for photos by a tag name, after clicking search the user will be redirected to a view that shows randomized results of the search query. The news feed page features paginating to ensure a smooth and fast experience in terms of loading time.



* Sprint 3: The user is able to add a like to a picture, a count of how many likes a picture has is shown as a number next to a heart glyphicon. The user can leave comments on pictures and can also edit pre-existing comments. At the picture show page users can also delete pictures that belong to them.
